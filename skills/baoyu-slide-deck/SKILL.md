## Design Philosophy

This deck is designed for **reading and sharing**, not live presentation:
- Each slide must be **self-explanatory** without verbal commentary
- Structure content for **logical flow** when scrolling
- Include **all necessary context** within each slide
- Optimize for **social media sharing** and offline reading

## File Management

### Output Directory

Each session creates an independent directory named by content slug:

```
slide-deck/{topic-slug}/
├── source-{slug}.{ext}    # Source files (text, images, etc.)
├── outline.md
├── outline-{style}.md     # Style variant outlines
├── prompts/
│   └── 01-slide-cover.md, 02-slide-{slug}.md, ...
├── 01-slide-cover.png, 02-slide-{slug}.png, ...
├── {topic-slug}.pptx
└── {topic-slug}.pdf
```

**Slug Generation**:
1. Extract main topic from content (2-4 words, kebab-case)
2. Example: "Introduction to Machine Learning" → `intro-machine-learning`

### Conflict Resolution

If `slide-deck/{topic-slug}/` already exists:
- Append timestamp: `{topic-slug}-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- Example: `intro-ml` exists → `intro-ml-20260118-143052`

### Source Files

Copy all sources with naming `source-{slug}.{ext}`:
- `source-article.md` (main text content)
- `source-diagram.png` (image from conversation)
- `source-data.xlsx` (additional file)

Multiple sources supported: text, images, files from conversation.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Content

1. Save source content (if pasted, save as `source.md`)
2. Follow `references/analysis-framework.md` for deep content analysis
3. Determine style (use `--style` or auto-select from signals)
4. Detect languages (source vs. user preference)
5. Plan slide count (`--slides` or dynamic)

### Step 2: Generate Outline Variants

1. Generate 3 style variant outlines based on content analysis
2. Follow `references/outline-template.md` for structure
3. Save as `outline-{style}.md` for each variant

### Step 3: User Confirmation

**Single AskUserQuestion with all applicable options:**

| Question | When to Ask |
|----------|-------------|
| Style variant | Always (3 options + custom) |
| Language | Only if source ≠ user language |

After selection:
- Copy selected `outline-{style}.md` to `outline.md`
- Regenerate in different language if requested
- User may edit `outline.md` for fine-tuning

If `--outline-only`, stop here.

### Step 4: Generate Prompts

1. Read `references/base-prompt.md`
2. Combine with style instructions from outline
3. Add slide-specific content
4. If `Layout:` specified in outline, include layout guidance in prompt:
   - Reference layout characteristics for image composition
   - Example: `Layout: hub-spoke` → "Central concept in middle with related items radiating outward"
5. Save to `prompts/` directory

### Step 5: Generate Images

1. Select available image generation skill
2. Generate session ID: `slides-{topic-slug}-{timestamp}`
3. Generate each slide with same session ID
4. Report progress: "Generated X/N"

### Step 6: Merge to PPTX and PDF

```bash
npx -y bun ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/merge-to-pptx.ts <slide-deck-dir>
npx -y bun ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/merge-to-pdf.ts <slide-deck-dir>
```

### Step 7: Output Summary

```
Slide Deck Complete!

Topic: [topic]
Style: [style name]
Location: [directory path]
Slides: N total

- 01-slide-cover.png ✓ Cover
- 02-slide-intro.png ✓ Content

Outline: outline.md
PPTX: {topic-slug}.pptx
PDF: {topic-slug}.pdf
```

## Slide Modification

See `references/modification-guide.md` for:
- Edit single slide workflow
- Add new slide (with renumbering)
- Delete slide (with renumbering)
- File naming conventions

## References

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `references/analysis-framework.md` | Deep content analysis for presentations |
| `references/outline-template.md` | Outline structure and STYLE_INSTRUCTIONS format |
| `references/modification-guide.md` | Edit, add, delete slide workflows |
| `references/content-rules.md` | Content and style guidelines |
| `references/base-prompt.md` | Base prompt for image generation |
| `references/styles/<style>.md` | Full style specifications |

## Notes

- Image generation: 10-30 seconds per slide
- Auto-retry once on generation failure
- Use stylized alternatives for sensitive public figures
- Maintain style consistency via session ID

## Extension Support

Custom styles and configurations via EXTEND.md.

**Check paths** (priority order):
1. `.baoyu-skills/baoyu-slide-deck/EXTEND.md` (project)
2. `~/.baoyu-skills/baoyu-slide-deck/EXTEND.md` (user)

If found, load before Step 1. Extension content overrides defaults.
